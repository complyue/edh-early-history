# ƒê - (WIP) a modern, transactional Object layer spliced with Haskell

Missing **Python**/**JavaScript** or even **Go** in shifting to
**Haskell**? Now you can have **Edh**, with many goodies from
those languages but running embedded in Haskell.

Having hard time for data consistency in programming concurrency?
The very
[Haskell implementation](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/stm)
of
[Software transactional memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory)
is an excellent relief, giving you lock-free (a.k.a optimistic locking)
transactions. **Edh** brings major advantages of **STM** to the object
layer, with eaiser and intuitive paradigm to program data consistency.

## Why a new programming language

### conceptual clearance

To stay conceptually clear for the object system (which is
[procedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming) per se)
living together with the
[functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
parts, there are only **procedures** but no **function** in **Edh** the
language. Simply put, in **Edh** terminology, a **procedure** tends to
_change the world_, while a **function** must stay
[side effect](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)>)
free.

### easy concurrency, auto parallelism, with easy data consistency

Any procedure, or even a `for` loop can be put to a new thread for concurrent
running with simply a `go` keyword prefixed to it. i.e. **goroutines**.

The **Haskell** runtime system is very good at leveraging multi-core CPUs
to run your concurrent program efficiently, and is very tunable for ideal
performance.

Building atop the excellent
[Haskell implementation](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/stm)
of
[Software transactional memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory)
, **Edh** code carries intrinsic transactional semantics.

Attribute assingment (including `(=)` `(+=)` `(-=)` `(*=)` `(/=)`),
`pair`/`tuple`/`list`/`dict` construction, arguments packing, etc. are all atomic
regarding concurrency.

And there's the magical `ai` (stands for **atomically** **isolatedly**) keyword,
when prefixed to a code block, the block runs in an isolated **STM** transaction
that either succeed or fail as a whole.

### lock-free serialization

The
[event `sink`](#goroutine-concurrency-control-and-sink-the-broadcasting-channel)
is implemented in a way that concurrent/parallel publications into it won't
block (actually won't even delay) each others, so you can implement a single
_back-storage-writer_ draining an event `sink`, then have multiple concurrent
_data-writers_ to the `sink`, to easily have the writes well serialized,
without worrying that slow writers may slow down fast writers.

Please make sure the _back-storage-writer_ is reasonably fast as necessary
though.

### more concise syntax for event handling

No more this:

```js
let tgt = ...

let handler1 = function() {
    if (<cond>) {
        tgt.unregister('evt-type', handler1)
        return
    }
    // ...
}

tgt.on('evt-type', handler1)
```

but this:

```js
let tgt = ...

go for evt from tgt.<evt-type> do {
    if <cond> then break
    // ...
}
```

### lossless decimal for numbers

see [details below](#lossless-decimal-for-numbers-1)

## Why splice

I have long been amused by how **Python** and **C++** work together.

> I use the modern [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/)
> toolchain, while **C++** with [boost](https://www.boost.org/)
> has worked longer, and **C** and **Python** has a even longer history of
> entanglement.

With **Python** code, you set a stage up with tensors forming a computation
network, with those tensors implemented in **C++**, while during full speed
sprinting, the tensor code can call **Python** from **C++** through some
bindings (**pybind** does most of that out-of-the-box), to tell the framework
to _shift gear_ in some parts.

Take away is: you use one language/runtime for flexibility/expressiveness,
and another for performance.

Haskell on its own has long achieved both in many domains, but in numeric
crunching, the overwhelming success of **Numpy**/**Pandas** came with good
reasons.

My take is that object semantics may be more powerful to describe the mutable
parts of your problem domain, while functional approach will be really fluent
when describing just the immutable parts.

And an object system is not necessarily strictly Object-Oriented in suiting
particular problems, sometimes just managing transitional states is enough,
e.g. Go solved many problems more fluently than other OO languages.

## Teasers

### Python style arguments passing

```javascript
// the Pythonic way of argument receiving
method f (x, y=10, *ns, **kwargs) {
    // ...
}

// the Pythonic way of argument sending
f (3, 7, 21, *[9, 11], name='doer', **{'msg': "you've got it", 'keynum': 2})
```

### and more of arguments receiving

```javascript
// simplified property setter method by leveraging argument retargetting
method setName (name as this._name) pass
method getName () this._name

// wild argument receiver
method g * {
    return "I guess you passed me a name '" ++ name
        ++ "', or I should've crashed!"
}
// but this is not really a good idea for api signature
g (name="Yesman")
```

### import by arguments receiving

```javascript
// while the wild argument receiver is bad for procedures, it's fairly
// acceptable for project local imports:
import * from './lib.edh'

// surely there'are more explicit forms for general imports,
// also see argument retargeting here:
import (doA, doB as thatB, **newGoodiesToKnow) from 'awsomelib'
if len(newGoodiesToKnow) > 0 then
    console.debug(
        "there're more functions from awsomelib, check that out:\n\t"
        ++ newGoodiesToKnow.keys())
```

> TODO demostrate `edh_modules` directory structure for dependency management
> akin to npm's `node_modules` structure.

### arguments sending, generators

```js
generator g (n) {
    for i from range(n) do
        // pack an arguments sender to yield out,
        // you'd feel it like calling a callback
        yield pack (i, i * i, desc="square of " ++ i)
}

// arguments receiver syntax in for expression,
// you'd feel it like defining a callback
for (x, y, desc="the result") from g(100) do
    console.log(x ++ ": " ++ desc ++ " is " ++ y)
```

### Go Type-Embedding style multiple _inheritance_

This is not geniune object-oriented inheritance though, but you'll go as far
and well as Go [Type Embedding](https://go101.org/article/type-embedding.html)
let you.

```javascript
class B (name) {
    method greeting(guest) {
        console.log("Hello "++guest++", I am "++name++', your guide.')
    }
}

class C () {
    extends B('Nobleman')
}

class D () {
    extends B('Farmer')

    method hello() {
        console.log(`Hello there!`)
    }
}

class E () {
    extends C()
    extends D()
    // an E object will contain 2 copies of B object,
    // the order above matters in resolving the `greeting` method.
}
```

### ES6 style symbol for better encapsulation

You can control the access to an object's attribute by binding it using a
symbol instead of an alphanumeric name.

```javascript
name = Symbol('name')

class C () {
    method getName() this.@name
    method setName(name as this.@name) pass
}
```

A symbol value is normally defined at the module level, so all procedures
in the module have access. And symbols are always resolved from lexical
scope, so foreign code can never obtain it from an object via attribute
reference. While a symbol can be passed to a _friend_ method procedure, to
grant it access.

```js
c = C()

// this won't success unless the calling scope has the same symbol value
// bound to it as an attribute named `name`.
c.@name

// a C object doesn't possess an alphanumeric attribute named `name`,
// this is illegal code:
c.name

// TODO add repl session example
```

### list/dict/tuple comprehension

```haskell
[] =< for x from range(100) do x*x
{} =< for x from range(100) do ("square of " ++ x, x*x)
(,) =< for x from range(100) do x*x
```

You can even comprehend into list/dict with existing data, this may be
good or bad depending on your opinion. But you have the option to
[override](#operator-override--creation) the `(=<)` operator to refuse
comprehending into non-empty list/dict!

> TODO ƒê repl session demo here

### list/dict modification

```haskell
let (l, d) = ([3,'foo',5], {'a': 'good', 'b': 9})

// append to a list/dict, just use the comprehension operator as well
l =< [2,'bar',9]; d =< {'b': 1, 'm': 'cool!'}

// prepend to a list, insert/update single entry to a dict,
// there's a dedicated operator (=>) for it
'baz' => l; ('n', 'yeah') => d
```

### goroutine, concurrency control, and `sink` the broadcasting channel

As shown below, we use `go` prefix to start new execution threads, and we
have `altog(*tasks)` and `concur(*tasks, c=<n>)` for concurrency control.

A `sink` is a multi-sender, multi-receiver broadcasting channel
for messages, comparable to a `chan` in Go, which is a multi-sender,
load-balanced-multi-receiver unicasting channel for messsages.

An _event_ message in **Edh** can be an `ArgsPack` created by `pack()`, then
further received by the _argument receiver_ of the `for` expression.

```js
class EventMonitor (evsSub, name="observer") {
    method ackEvents (maxN=5) {
        ackN = 0
        for (t, description, **) from evsSub do {
            ackN += 1
            console.info(name ++ " got #" ++ ackN ++ " event: "
                ++ description ++ " @ " ++ t)
            if ackN >= maxN then break
        }
    }
}

class EventProducer (evsStop, evsPub, name="announcer") {
    evtCnt = 0
    method reportSummary() {
        console.info(name ++ " totally dispatched " ++ evtCnt ++ " event(s).")
    }
    method giveTiming (interval) {
        defer this.reportSummary()

        // `altog` schedules specified concurrent tasks to run altogether,
        // the rest tasks will be cancelled upon any of them to finish first
        altog (
            for _ from evsStop do break,
            for currentTime from runtime.everyMillisN(interval) do {
                this.evtCnt += 1
                evsPub <- pack (t=currentTime, n=evtCnt,
                    description="Event#" ++ evtCnt)
            }
        )
    }
}

evsLiveCast = sink

// `concur` schedules the specified number of tasks to run at the same time,
// with all specified tasks in backlog
concur (
    EventMonitor(evsLiveCast, "Mon1").ackEvents(3),
    EventMonitor(evsLiveCast, "Mon2").ackEvents(2),
    EventMonitor(evsLiveCast, "Mon3").ackEvents(3),
    EventMonitor(evsLiveCast, "Mon4").ackEvents(1),
    EventMonitor(evsLiveCast, "Mon5").ackEvents(5),

    c=2 // keep at max 2 concurrent tasks at a time
)

evsStop = sink
go EventProducer(evsStop, evsLiveCast).giveTiming(1.5e3)

for _ from runtime.afterMillisN(60e3) do
    evsStop <- nil
```

### Haskell style case-of, with Go style fallthrough

```haskell
let essay = case type(v) of {
   BoolType -> "to be or not to be, that's a problem"
   DecimalType -> {
      |v<2 -> "consume less, produce more"
      |v<10 -> "no more than " ++ v ++ " cups of coffee a day"
      true -> "every one get his/her lucky number"
   }
   StringType -> (quiz=v fallthrough)
   SymbolType -> (quiz='mistery attracts most people' fallthrough)
   ModuleType -> (quiz='I live in ' ++ v.__name__; fallthrough)
   "do you known, that " ++ quiz ++ " ?"
}
```

### ternary operator

in **C** you do:

```C
onCnd ? oneThing : theOther
```

and in **Python** you do:

```python
onCnd and oneThing or theOther
```

well in **Edh** you do:

```haskell
onCnd &> oneThing |> theOther
```

### operator override / creation

You should be supprised that the following language constructs are all
implemented as overridable operators:

- assignment
  - (`=`), (`+=`), (`-=`), (`*=`), (`/=`)
- logical arithmetic
  - (`&&`), (`||`)
- ternary
  - (`&>`), (`|>`)
- list/dict/tuple comprehension/concatenation
  - (`=<`)
- list/dict prepend/insert
  - (`=>`)
- publish an event to a sink
  - (`<-`)
- case branch
  - (`->`)
- string coercing concatenation
  - (`++`)

Meaning you can override them for the entire **Edh** world, or part of the
program scope (e.g. a module, a class).

And you can even roll your own, arbitrary new operators with a precendence
you'd like with, as so similar as **Haskell** allows you.

Some operators are implemented in **Haskell** the host language, some are
just implemented in **Edh**, take any of them as example for your own
operator implementation:

```hs
-- | operator (=)
assignProc :: EdhProcedure
assignProc (PackSender [SendPosArg !lhExpr, SendPosArg !rhExpr]) that _ !exit =
  do
    pgs <- ask
    -- execution of the assignment always in a tx for atomicity
    local (\pgs' -> pgs' { edh'in'tx = True })
      $ evalExpr that rhExpr
      $ assignEdhTarget pgs that lhExpr exit
assignProc !argsSender _ _ _ =
  throwEdh EvalError $ "Unexpected operator args: " <> T.pack (show argsSender)

-- | utility type(*args,**kwargs)
typeProc :: EdhProcedure
typeProc !argsSender !that _ !exit = do
  !pgs <- ask
  let !callerCtx   = edh'context pgs
      !callerScope = contextScope callerCtx
  packEdhArgs that argsSender
    $ \(_, _, EdhArgsPack (ArgsPack !args !kwargs)) ->
        let !argsType = edhTypeOf <$> args
        in  if null kwargs
              then case argsType of
                [t] -> exitEdhProc exit (that, callerScope, t)
                _   -> exitEdhProc exit (that, callerScope, EdhTuple argsType)
              else exitEdhProc
                exit
                ( that
                , callerScope
                , EdhArgsPack $ ArgsPack argsType $ Map.map edhTypeOf kwargs
                )
```

```c++
  operator != (lhv, rhv) not (lhv == rhv)

  operator &> (scope, lhe, rhe) {
    lhv = scope.eval(lhe)
    if lhv != false && lhv != nil && lhv != ''
      then scope.eval(rhe)
      else nil
  }

  operator |> (scope, lhe, rhe) {
    lhv = scope.eval(lhe)
    if lhv == false || lhv == nil || lhv == ''
      then scope.eval(rhe)
      else lhv
  }

  operator += (scope, lhe, rhe) {
    scope.eval(makeOp(
      lhe, "=", makeOp(lhe, "+", rhe)
    ))
  }
```

All operators in **Edh** are left associative, infix only, though. Well,
except a few hardcoded prefix operators:

- (`+`) prefix plus
- (`-`) prefix minus
- (`not`) prefix bool negation
- (`|`) guard
- the keyword `go` and `defer` are implemented as prefix operator

### indexing override (Numpy/Pandas upon Repa/AccelerateHS)

The indexing syntax is a special case (not an infix operator), but very
crucial for tasks e.g. porting **Numpy** to **Edh**. As **Edh** allows
parenthesis quoted operator symbol as attribute name, such a method can be
written:

```js
class ndarray (*args, **kwargs) {
    method ([]) (ix) {
        // ix can be scalar, slice or tuple of them ...
    }
}
```

With some additional tricks in the language, including parsing **Python**
style index keys, i.e. slice syntax with (:) and (,) to create tuple key
within the indexing bracket ([]) pair, then finally redirecting indexing
against an object to method ([]), it'll be much similar as implementing
`__getitem__(self, ix)` as in **Python**.

> based on [Repa](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/repa) /
> [AccerlerateHS](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/accelerate).

### lossless decimal for numbers

In JavaScript, even today, all numbers are `float64`, it puzzled me a while,
before I figured out this is the reason why we can not have `Int64Array`
besides `Int32Array`/`Int16Array`/`Float64Array`/`Float32Array` etc. that
the language simply unable to handle elements from an `Int64Array` if it's
ever provided.

Python gives you lossless integers by default, but `float64` for decimal:

```python
>>> 1.1 + 2.2
3.3000000000000003
>>>
```

Haskell forces you to choose a type for every number in your program,
normal options including the lossless `Integer`, bounded `Int`, and
precision-lossing `Double`/`Float`:

```haskell
Œª> 1.1 + 2.2 :: Double
3.3000000000000003
Œª> 1.1 + 2.2 :: Float
3.3000002
Œª>
```

And you have `Data.Scientific` for the rescure, but with its own quirks
from practical daily use:

```haskell
Œª> :m +Data.Scientific
Œª> x = 1.1 + 2.2 :: Scientific
Œª> x
3.3
Œª> x / 0
*** Exception: Ratio has zero denominator
Œª>
```

> Your compiled Haskell program will crash on division-by-zero if not
> handled specifically.

Then here's `Data.Lossless.Decimal` from package
[lossless-decimal](https://github.com/complyue/edh/tree/master/lossless-decimal)

```haskell
Œª> x = 1.1 + 2.2 :: Decimal
Œª> x
3.3
Œª> x / 0
inf
Œª> (-x) / 0
-inf
Œª> 0/0 :: Decimal
nan
Œª> (0/0 :: Decimal) == 0/0
False
Œª> pi = Decimal 1 (-40) 31415926535897932384626433832795028841971
Œª> pi
3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971
Œª>
```

All numbers in **Edh** are `Data.Lossless.Decimal` from
[lossless-decimal](https://github.com/complyue/edh/tree/master/lossless-decimal)
, by default and by all means:

```
...
```

### reflection

...

## The name

Edh stands for **Event Distributing & Hosting**

ƒê is a more stylish, single letter, symbolic name of **Edh** the language

## Acknowledgement

Edh's parser is built with
[Megaparsec](https://github.com/mrkkrp/megaparsec) (
[on hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec) ),
parser making with Megaparsec is so pleasant.

The development of **Edh** was started from cloning
[monkey-hs](https://github.com/utatti/monkey-hs)
by Hyunje Jun, but later re-written entirely.
