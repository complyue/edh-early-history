# Đ - (WIP) a modern Object layer spliced with Haskell

Missing Python/JavaScript or even Go in shifting to
Haskell? Now you can have Edh, with many goodies from
those languages but running embedded in Haskell.

# Acknowledgement

Edh's parser is built with
[Megaparsec](https://github.com/mrkkrp/megaparsec) (
[on hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec) ),
parser making with Megaparsec is so pleasant.

The development of Edh was started from cloning
[monkey-hs](https://github.com/utatti/monkey-hs)
by Hyunje Jun, but later re-written entirely.
