# ƒê - (WIP) a modern Object layer spliced with Haskell

Missing Python/JavaScript or even Go in shifting to
Haskell? Now you can have Edh, with many goodies from
those languages but running in Haskell.

# Acknowledgement

The development of Edh was started from cloning
[monkey-hs](https://github.com/utatti/monkey-hs)
by Hyunje Jun, but later re-written entirely.
